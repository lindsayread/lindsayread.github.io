I just finished my first week of Data Science Bootcamp at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) (woohoo!). I began my journey 3 months ago when I quit my job in Microbiology to pursue a career in Data Science. After committing to learning Python full-time (shoutout to [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/), I was ready to apply to Metis Data Science in May and got in! Upon acceptance, I quickly moved into the prework for the bootcamp which consisted of around 60 hours of learning and applying python, linear algebra, and statistics. Before I knew it, bootcamp had begun!

We hit the ground running on the first day of class, where we were assigned our first data science project: WomenTechWomenYes, a non-profit organization seeking to increase the participation of women in technology, is holding a gala at the beginning of the summer and wants our input as to how to best place their street team to gather signatures of people who would want to attend the gala and contribute to this organization. They want to place their street teams near entrances of subway stations, but aren't sure which ones or when - this is where they need our help.

At the start of this project, my team discussed several ideas of what we could do to optimize the placememt of the street teams:
1. Which subway stations are the busiest?
2. What time of the day are these stations busiest?
3. What day of the week are they busiest?
4. Which stations do we want to target based on the likelihood of our target audience (people interested in technology, especially women) being at these subway stations?

Once we had a general idea of what sort of insights we wanted to discover, we needed to find a dataset (or several data sets) that we could analyze to transform these insights. The first, and main, dataset that we used is [Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html), which contains ridership information for the MTA Subways in New York City for all weeks from 10/18/14 to the current week. We decided to look specifically at the 2 months leading up to the gala (April and May 2019), as people riding the subway during these dates are more likely to still be around in a month or two when the gala is taking place.

Next, we needed to clean our data so we could actually use it and apply it towards our goal insights. 

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
